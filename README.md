# TemperatureConverter

I did this temperature conversion tool when I was learning Python. I would say that it hard to break this program.


It has a graphical user interface, fonts and other sizes try to adapt to screen resolution. It converts various temperatures in various ways. Also, you can read interesting facts about the people who discovered these temperatures. 

Unfortunately, everything is in Lithuanian, so a translator is needed.
